## Writing Samples

I regularly write technical articles on Medium. Here are some of my recent publications:

1. [Understanding Message Queue and Its role in System Architecture](https://medium.com/@kuldeepranjan39/message-queue-e2085636b6f5):
It is an architectural pattern that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled, fine-grained services, communicating with each other through lightweight protocols.
Communication between these different services plays a vital role in delivering at scale and this is where Message Queue comes into the picture to facilitate persistent and efficient data exchange between services.
Read more about this in my Blog on Medium to understand its technical side and use cases in real-world applications.
